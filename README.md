# ruspy
A rust-inspired memory safe Python compiler that ensures strict safety guarantees while maintaining python's flexibility,  get the features of rust without having to learn it , simplicity of python safety of rust 
Objectives -
1. memory saftey - Prevents segmentation faults , null pointer errors and unsafe memory access.
2. Thread safety - Implements strict concurrency checks to avoid race conditions
3. Rust like safety model - borrow cheacker t anage without a garbage collector
4. Static Typing support - enforces stricter type Checking while maintaining pythons flexibility
5. Performance optimization = Generates efficient machine code , reducing runtime overhead
6. Interoperability = Allows interactions with Existing Python Libraries
7. Licensed under Apache 2.0 contributions welcome.

why this project exixts - 
a. To make safer alternative to CPython
B. Offers safety benifits without needing to rewrite code in rust
c. Compiled execution is faster than Pythons interpreted runtime
